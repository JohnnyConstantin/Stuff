<h2>Second reason is your dreams<br><br><br>The Tesla Roadster is a battery electric vehicle (BEV) sports car, evolved from the Lotus Elise chassis, that was produced by Tesla Motors (now Tesla, Inc.) in California from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway legal serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 320 km (200 miles) per charge. It is also the first production car to be launched into orbit, carried by a Falcon Heavy rocket in a test flight on February 6, 2018.</h2>
